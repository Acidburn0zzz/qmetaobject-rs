This example is showing that you can use plugins with qml builder.
It is base on the `qmlextensionplugins` example found in the qtdeclarative
source code. It needs the QML files from that example in the Qt source tree.

Build with:

 cargo build


Run with:

 qmlscene -P ./target/debug/ \
    -I $QTSRCDIR/qtdeclarative/examples/qml/qmlextensionplugins/imports \
    $QTSRCDIR/qtdeclarative/examples/qml/qmlextensionplugins/plugins.qml

Where $QTSRCDIR is the path to the Qt source
