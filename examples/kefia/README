Here is patches to port the kefia examples from  qml-rust to the qmetaobject crate.

To try this example, go to the parent repository of qmetaobject-rs, and run

  git clone https://github.com/White-Oak/kefia
  cd kefia
  git am ../qmetaobject-rs/examples/kefia/*.patch
  cargo run

(The patches apply to commit ec8b9ed82446b79f1eece70860cc1995c2d43558)
